# Scalable Spinner Controls for WPF

This project contains (or will contain) vector-based busy indicators for 
XAML/WPF that scale to any needed size.  When looking for
"spinners" to show when the application was busy I could only 
find controls online that assumed a fixed size, say 20-40 pixels.

But often I wanted indicator to stretch to the parent or container or
I simply wanted to set to size to some arbitrary number.  Using something
raster-based is not a good choice due to pixelation.  So I developer this
project to server as a collection.

The original spinner paths were created in CAD as DWG and then converted to Adobe
Illustrator AI files after exporting to DXF.  The paths created in the AI were 
copy/pasted over to XAML.  The following resources can be used for anyone
interested in editing or creating their own:
